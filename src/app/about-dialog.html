  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Handwriting recognition is one of the compelling research works going on because every individual in this 
    world has their own style of writing. It is the capability of the computer to identify and understand 
    handwritten digits or characters automatically. Because of the progress in the field of science and 
    technology, everything is being digitalized to reduce human effort. Hence, there comes a need for 
    handwritten digit recognition in many real-time applications. MNIST data set is widely used for this 
    recognition process and it has 70000 handwritten digits. We use Artificial neural networks to train these 
    images and build a deep learning model. Web application is created where the user can upload an image of 
    a handwritten digit. this image is analyzed by the model and the detected result is returned on to UI.</p>

  <h3>Procedure</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Login -- </b>This is first page when you entered into the webapp. If you entered the user credentials(i.e.,Email id, Password) correctly, you are redirected to the next page</li>
    <li><b>Upload -- </b>In this page, you can upload the handwritten digit image from your local system. Immediately after pick the image, preview of the image is shown to you for extra verification.</li>
    <li><b>Result -- </b>The predicted value of the image that you upload is shown in this page. Column chart is also provided to see the result in graphical representation.</li>
  </ol>
